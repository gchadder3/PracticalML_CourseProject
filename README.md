# PracticalML_CourseProject

This repo contains my course project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course.  The following files are important:

* raw_script_PA1.R: the script used to develop the report
* PA1.Rmd: the R Markdown file used to generate the report
* [PA1.html](https://gchadder3.github.io/PracticalML_CourseProject/PA1.html): the knitr-generated HTML file (in the gh-pages branch of the repo)
